## Game Modes

### Anti-Social Mode

"Classic falling block gameplay" without the Bluesky features. Stack pieces to complete horizontal lines - completed lines are cleared and you earn points. You know the drill.

**Scoring:**
- Single line: 100 points
- Double: 300 points
- Triple: 500 points
- Quadruple: 800 points

Points are multiplied by your current level. The game speeds up as you level up. This is the same for all game modes.
